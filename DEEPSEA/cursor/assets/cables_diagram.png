# This is a placeholder for cables_diagram.png
# In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image file showing:
# - Underwater cable network topology
# - Sensor positions along cables
# - Geographic layout of cable routes
# - Connection points and amplifiers

# To add an actual image:
# 1. Create or obtain a cables diagram image
# 2. Save it as cables_diagram.png in this directory
# 3. Update dashboard.py to load and display this image
