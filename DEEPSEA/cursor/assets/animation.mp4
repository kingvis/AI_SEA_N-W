# This is a placeholder for animation.mp4
# In a real implementation, this would be an MP4 video file showing:
# - Animated visualization of data flow through cables
# - Real-time anomaly detection alerts
# - Dynamic network health monitoring
# - Time-series data visualization

# To add an actual animation:
# 1. Create or obtain an animation video
# 2. Save it as animation.mp4 in this directory
# 3. Update dashboard.py to embed and play this video
# 4. Consider using libraries like moviepy for video generation
